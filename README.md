# react-d3-boilerplate
This is a simple boilerplate application that has d3 integrated with react.

### Instructions

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run start`
4. The server is now up and running at http://localhost:8080

### Notes

1. This boilerplate has d3 v4.0 loaded with it. You can learn more about what has changed by viewing [this link.](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/CHANGES.md)
2. To revert to an older version of d3, run `npm uninstall d3` followed by `npm install d3@3.5.17`
3. This boilerplate uses webpack to load and serve (I think! I'm fairly new to react and I'm not sure if I got my terms correctly).
